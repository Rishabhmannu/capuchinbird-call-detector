# Capuchinbird Call Detector 🎶🦜

A deep learning–powered tool for detecting **Capuchinbird calls** in audio recordings.  
Built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, and signal processing techniques, this project lets you upload or select audio samples, run real-time inference, and visualize detected bird calls with waveform plots, spectrograms, and probability curves.

## ✨ Features
- Upload `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.m4a` files, or choose from built-in sample recordings.
- Adjustable **detection parameters**: threshold, consecutive windows, and min-gap merging.
- Rich **visualizations**:
  - Waveform with highlighted detections
  - Spectrogram with detected spans
  - Per-window probability curves
- Download detected events as a **CSV** file.
- Built with **TensorFlow on Apple Silicon** (MPS) for fast local inference.
