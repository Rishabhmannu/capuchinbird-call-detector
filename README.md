# Capuchinbird Call Detector ðŸŽ¶ðŸ¦œ

A deep learningâ€“powered tool for detecting **Capuchinbird calls** in audio recordings.  
Built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, and signal processing techniques, this project lets you upload or select audio samples, run real-time inference, and visualize detected bird calls with waveform plots, spectrograms, and probability curves.

## âœ¨ Features
- Upload `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.m4a` files, or choose from built-in sample recordings.
- Adjustable **detection parameters**: threshold, consecutive windows, and min-gap merging.
- Rich **visualizations**:
  - Waveform with highlighted detections
  - Spectrogram with detected spans
  - Per-window probability curves
- Download detected events as a **CSV** file.
- Built with **TensorFlow on Apple Silicon** (MPS) for fast local inference.

## ðŸ§  Model & Performance

The detection model is a lightweight **2D CNN** trained on spectrograms of audio windows:

- **Architecture**: 2 Conv2D layers â†’ Flatten â†’ Dense (ReLU) â†’ Dense (Sigmoid)  
- **Parameters**: ~28K (tiny, fast to run locally, even on CPU/MPS)  
- **Input**: STFT magnitude spectrograms of 50,000-sample (~3s) windows  
- **Output**: Probability of Capuchinbird call in each window  

### Training
- **Dataset**: Positive (Capuchinbird calls) vs. Negative (other sounds) audio clips  
- **Augmentations**: Basic slicing, padding, overlapping windows  
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.001 with decay)  
- **Class imbalance** handled with **class weights**  

### Performance (Validation Set)
- **Best AUC**: ~0.98  
- **Best F1-score**: ~0.90 @ threshold â‰ˆ 0.68  
- **Precision/Recall tradeoff** adjustable at inference with threshold slider  

The model is designed to **favor recall** (i.e., rarely miss true calls) while still keeping precision reasonable.  
Post-processing with **k-consecutive window filtering** and **min-gap merging** reduces false positives from short noise bursts.
